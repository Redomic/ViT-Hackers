TECHEDEN 2.0: Safety

## How to use

Requirements:
- Postgres
- Node.js

Steps:
- Setup a local postgres database on port 5432, user postgres
- Install postgis via stack builder
- Create table via code given in .sql file in frontend/db
- open terminal and type 'npm ci' (installs packages) in frontend and backend folders.
- 'npm start' in frontend and backend to start localhost
- Done! Open http://localhost:3000 to see the application

## Problem statement
**Selected problem statement 25:**
Develop a tool that helps people in war-ridden countries navigate around safely


## What it does
A **highly scalable application that uses** real-time information about on-ground situations to inform users and helps them evacuate safely.
- Map integration - Dynamic zoning based on information
- Creates a network between people
- Find and form groups
- Get basic supplies like medicine, food, and shelter
- Nearby hospitals, military safe zones, and governments camps marked and verified by users

## How We built it
Built using the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Nodejs) 

## Challenges we ran into
Map integration and setting up the backend

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As first-timer hackathon participants, finishing and building a prototype within 24 hours felt good. We're incredibly proud of that.

## What we learned
That hackathons are draining and hard. Requires dedication to sit down and get things done within such a short span of time.

## What's next for Safely - ViT Hackers
We have plans to add even more features and polish out the product, we want to integrate a short-range, low-cost communication device using decentralized protocols to add support to areas without connectivity.
